The lion (Panthera leo) is the second-largest member of the cat family, surpassed only by the tiger. Native to the grasslands and savannas of Sub-Saharan Africa—with a small, critically endangered population in India—lions are unique among big cats for their social structure. They live in groups called prides, typically consisting of 5 to 20 individuals, including related females, their offspring, and a few males. Male lions are easily recognized by their thick manes, which serve both as a display of dominance and protection during fights. Lions are apex predators, feeding primarily on large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. They are capable of reaching speeds up to 80 km/h (50 mph) during short bursts when hunting. Despite their fierce reputation, lions spend much of their time resting—up to 21 hours a day. Their ability to survive for days without water and to go a week without food after a large meal showcases their remarkable adaptation to harsh environments.
